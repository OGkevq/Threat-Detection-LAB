# Threat Detection LAB

## Objective

The Threat Detection Lab project was a simulated scenario in which a penetration tester attempted to execute malware samples on a device. My job was to use PicoSecure Tools to detect the attacks. Each time I detected an attack, I would have to use a new method of detection for the next attack. This helped to build my defensive strategies as well as understand the Pyramid of Pain Framework.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in analyzing malware
- Ability to recognize attack patterns
- Create Rules to detect cyberattacks 
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- PicoSecure Malware Sandbox
- Firewall & Hash managers
- DNS Filter
- Sigma Rule Builder

## Steps
This lab was set up on a virtual machine through TryHackMe
1. Analyze the "sample1.exe" using the the Malware Sandbox Tool
2. Review the results from the analysis
